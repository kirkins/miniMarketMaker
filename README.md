# Mini-Market-Maker

An example GUI application for working with the Binance API.

Uses React, Electron, and AntD.

To start run:

    yarn 
    yarn build
    yarn electron-dev

Workflow of project:

- Enter your Binance API information under settings and save
- Auto-complete gets a list of available trading pairs
- Auto-fills buy/sell price but you can change your desire
- Check box indicates if you want to execute buy or sell first
- Once a buy or sell is executed the opposite order is automatically placed for the same amount

This was a proto-type built quickly as a concept.

End-goal was to have multiple pairs displayed as tabs on the left of the page.

Not activily working on this now, use this code as you wish.
